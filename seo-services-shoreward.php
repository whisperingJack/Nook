            <p class="bold_text">Site Summary:</p>
            <p>Overall the site has the bare bones of functionality (excluding on tablets) however there is no optimisation of code, in my opinion a misguided focus on targeting the wrong keyword on the wrong page and some examples of bad SEO practices. The good news is there is a huge scope for improvement in all areas. I recommend implementing the changes noted on two site pages to begin with: retargeting the home page to your industry (construction) and working on a second targeted page focusing on a niche keyword opportunity that will be revealed with further research. </p>
