            <h3>Optimisation &amp; Targeted Marketing Analysis</h3>
       
            <p> Nook Digital Marketing will analyse your website for code optimisation and content targeting based on our comprehensive <a href="http://nookdigitalmarketing.com.au/seo-checklist.php">SEO checklist.</a></p>
        <ul>
            
            <li>We look at the technical aspects of the site from the files on the server and it's location, to the code (HTML, CSS, Javascript) and the size of the images (among other things).</li>
            
            <li>We determine how the website is targeted and how you rank in Google's search engine for those words and phrases.</li>
            
            <li>The checklist will provide you with section summaries as well as an overall site score for easy reference.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>   
            <p>Each task on the checklist is worth 1 point and is not weighted, regardless of it's impact to SEO. </p>
            
            <p>The goal is to achieve the top score. Please contact us today for your free site analysis.</p>
